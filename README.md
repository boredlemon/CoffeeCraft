## Running
See [Releases](https://github.com/coffee/coffeeCraft-JAVA/releases/tag/java)

See below to build and run for yourself or try to run it out of any decent Java IDE.

*Please note* that in order to run the .jar file directly you will need at least the Java 14 runtime installed. 

## Build And Run
___
MACOS

- Mac: `$ ./package.sh` creates `Coffeecraft-1.0.dmg` which contains the application COFFEECRAFT.app.
- ./package.sh will run and start the application!
___
WINDOWS

- Windows: `package.bat` creates `COFFEECRAFT-1.0.exe` file which installs COFFEECRAFT.exe to `C:\Program Files\COFFEECRAFT`.

- With any OS and a valid JDK 14+ install, both `package.{sh, bat}` create `out\artifacts\Coffeecraft_jar\Coffeecraft.jar` which can be run on its own with `java -jar out\artifacts\Coffeecraft_jar\Coffeecraft.jar`
